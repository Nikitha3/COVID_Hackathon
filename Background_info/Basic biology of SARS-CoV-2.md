# Primer on the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2

Although the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has only recently emerged, there is
already a large amount of information about its biology that researchers have discovered.

If you need to catch up on the basics about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease,
refer to the following sections.

### Virus structure

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is most closely related
to the SARS coronavirus that led to an epidemic of respiratory disease in 2002-2004, hence its 
name. Coronaviruses use RNA as their genetic material (instead DNA as human cells use for their genomes).
This RNA is positive-sense, meaning it is similar to the natural messenger RNAs that human cells translate 
into proteins and can recruit an infected cell's ribosomes to make viral proteins. Coronaviruses have
among the largest genomes of any known virus family, with the genome of SARS-CoV-2 measuring 29.9 kb.
Although the total number of protein-coding genes the genome encodes is not certain, it is between 24 to 29. 

It is an enveloped virus, surrounding its RNA genome in a lipid membrane just as human cells are surrounded 
by membrane. The genome is coiled inside and tethered to the membrane through the viral Nucleocapsid (N) 
protein. An Envelope (E) protein helps maintain the structure of the viral membrane, as might a transmembrane-spanning
protein known as the Membrane (M) protein. On the outside surface of the virus there are large Spike (S) 
proteins that form crown-shaped trimers. These spikes are the virus' attachment point to host cells.


### Entry into human cells

As a respiratory virus, the most common mode of entry into the human body is through the upper
airway (which includes nasal passageways and the pharynx / throat). The virus enters
cells that express the receptor ACE2, which normally acts as a membrane-tethered enzyme that controls
blood pressure. Many kinds of epithelial cells lining the airways and alveolar cells in the lungs express 
ACE2 and are thought to be the first major entry point for the virus. First the virus attaches to the host cell through
binding of its spike protein to ACE2. Then, another cell-surface enzyme on the human cell called TMPRSS2 
cuts the spike protein in a way that exposes inner regions of the spike which then allow the viral membrane
to fuse with the host cell membrane. Other enzymes may be able to function in place of TMPRSS2 to cleave the 
spike, including FURIN. Once the virus fuses with the host cell, its RNA genome is injected into the cell
and can begin replicating.

Although this pathway of viral entry through ACE2 is the most established, other human receptors that
may aid viral entry have been proposed. It is also noteworthy that ACE2 is broadly expressed in other 
tissues such as the heart, brain, and intestines, which may account for known COVID-19 symptoms affecting
those organs.


### Replication and life cycle

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has evolved features which allow it to be turned into proteins as if it
were a normal messenger RNA from the cell. The virus first translates a set of proteases. These
proteases participate in the assembly of the virus and can interfere with the host cell's functioning.
A series of non-structural proteins (NSPs) then can form a viral polymerase complex that 
is able to copy the RNA genome into new RNA genomes through a 2-step discontinuous transcription 
process. Unusually for a virus, coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 include proofreading enzymes 
during their replication which greatly reduces the frequency of mutations.

At the rough endoplasmic reticulum, new viral particles start forming enclosed within layers of membrane.
Structural proteins for the virus are packaged inside these new viral envelopes, while other proteins
from the virus remain inside the host cell and could be involved in functions including causing rupturing
of the host cell and blocking antiviral responses. Vesicles with new viral particles inside them then
go to the host cell's outer membrane where they are released through exocytosis. On average a few initial 
viruses that enter the cell can become thousands once replication is complete.

In addition to humans, other mammals are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chinese bats 
are suspected of being the original source of the virus, as a very similar virus (RaTG13) was found in a bat 
population relatively close to Wuhan where the COVID-19 pandemic began. While bats are the suspected 
reservoirs, an intermediate host mammal is suspected to have facilitated the jump from bats to humans. 


### Disease pathology

Typically it takes 3-5 days following infection before symptoms are noticeable. Many symptoms relate to the 
lungs, and include persistent cough and shortness of breath. As the immune system tries to fight off the
virus, a fever is generally triggered. However a significant proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2
do not develop noticeable symptoms, particularly if they are young and lack major prior health conditions.

Severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 typically center on lung dysfunction. The immune response itself may in some cases
contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs (edema). One hypothesis is that over-activation of immune cells
leads to storms of the cytokine signals immune cells use to stimulate each other, and consequently an over-killing of 
cells that can lead to tissue damage and fluid buildup. Regardless of the cause, as the lungs fill with fluid breathing
becomes more difficult. While acute respiratory distress is the most common cause of death, clots and cardiac failures 
are also common, and damage to other organs such as kidneys are frequently documented.

The percent of infected individuals who die from the virus is estimated between 0.2 - 1.4%, although with some uncertainty. 
This is far below the measured case fatality rates of either SARS or the related coronavirus MERS, which were estimated at 10%
or above. Other coronaviruses in the family, such as OC43 and HKU1, only are responsible for mild cold-like illness and are 
rarely fatal despite their similarities to these other beta-coronaviruses.
