## What interesting questions still need to be answered?

- What are the cell types that the virus is able to infect? 
	- Which cells express the known ACE2 receptor?
	- Where are the enzymes such as TMPRSS2 that are needed for viral entry found?
	- For putative new receptors or entry factors, where are they found in the body?

- How does the virus interact with the body's natural interferon antivral response?
	- Are interferon-regulated genes differentially expressed in infected cells?
	- How does interferon expression compare between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections?
	
- Does it look like viral infection is triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis)?
	- Is there upregulation of genes known to be linked to apoptosis such as CASP3?
	- In the single-cell data, do cells from infected patients appear less healthy?
