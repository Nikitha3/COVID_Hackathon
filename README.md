# COVID_Hackathon
*2020 Hackathon for exploring COVID19 datasets, organized by the Cambridge Synthetic Biology Society*

Please refer to the "CUSynBioSoc COVID-19 Hackathon.pdf" document for hackathon guidelines and judging criteria.

The "Datasets" folder contains all the processed data, associated metadata, and descriptions of the experiments
that generated those data

The "Background_info" folder contains guides for those needing to learn more about coding for data analysis,
a short review of what's known about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a document of questions which you can use as 
a starting point to guide your analyses if you don't know where to begin. 


Team chats are on Slack (https://cusbs.slack.com/) \
If you'd like to have video calls with your team, you can either use the 
call functionality built into Slack or use our rooms on Cambridge's Timeout platform
