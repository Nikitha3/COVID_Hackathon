# Binding measurements of viral spike mutants

This dataset describes a saturation-mutagenesis experiment done on the receptor-binding domain
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' spike protein. For every amino acid in the protein domain, mutant variants
were generated for every possible other amino acid (out of the 20 standard amino acids) 
that could exist at that position. Thus every possible single-position mutation is tested for its
ability to bind to the virus' known ACE2 receptor. The measurements for spike binding to ACE2-expressing
cells have already been normalized.
