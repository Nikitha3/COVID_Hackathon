## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


This is a notebook exploring the SARS-CoV-2 mutagenic data. The first step is to import the tidyverse library which will be used to conduct exploratory data analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

file<-read.csv("data.csv",header= TRUE, sep=",")
file

bool<-file[file$Residue..==19, ]


#tdiff = bool$Top_rep1 bool$Bottom_rep1

counts <- table(bool$Top_rep1,bool$Bottom_rep1)
barplot(counts, main="Spike plot for '19' residue rep1",
  xlab="Amino number", col=c("darkblue","red"),
  legend = rownames(counts), beside=TRUE)

#mut=bool$Substitution[which.max(tdiff)]

#print(mut)


```
